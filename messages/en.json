          "payments": {
            "question": "How do payments work?",
            "answer": "When you book a service, we authorize a hold on your payment method. Funds are only captured after the service is completed. Professionals receive payment within 2-3 business days after service completion. All payments are processed securely through PCI DSS Level 1 certified processors."

          "recurring": {
            "question": "Can I book recurring services?",
