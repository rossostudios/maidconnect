### Common Booking Issues

4. Customer no-shows
5. Time extension disputes
6. GPS check-in failures
7. Booking modification requests

---

### Issue 2A: Customer Cancellation Requests

**Priority:** P1 (if within 24 hours of service), P2 (if >24 hours)

**Process:**
1. Check booking status and scheduled time
2. Calculate cancellation timing:
   - **>48 hours before:** 100% refund
   - **24-48 hours before:** 50% refund
   - **<24 hours before:** No refund (policy exception only)
3. Apply cancellation policy
4. Process refund if applicable
5. Notify professional (auto-notification)
6. Confirm with customer

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've processed your cancellation for booking [Booking ID] scheduled for [Date/Time].

Based on our cancellation policy:
- Cancellation timing: [X hours before service]
- Refund amount: [X% / $X COP]
- Refund timeline: 5-10 business days to your original payment method

[If no refund]: I understand this isn't the outcome you hoped for. Our cancellation policy ensures professionals are compensated for blocked time. For future bookings, canceling more than 48 hours in advance ensures a full refund.

Is there anything else I can help with?

Best,
[Agent Name]
```

**Policy Exception Criteria:**
- Medical emergency (documentation required)
- Death in family (documentation required)
- Natural disaster or emergency

**Immediate Actions (if customer is currently waiting):**
1. Confirm professional didn't GPS check-in
2. Attempt to contact professional (call + message)

   - Issue immediate full refund
   - Offer rebooking assistance (priority matching)
   - Flag professional account for review
4. Update customer with status

**Response Template (Customer Waiting):**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm so sorry this happened. I've confirmed [Professional Name] hasn't checked in, and I've been unable to reach them.

Here's what I've done:
✅ Issued full refund (will appear in 5-10 business days)
✅ Flagged the professional's account for review
✅ Your next booking will get priority matching

Can I help you rebook with a different professional right now? I'll make sure you get someone highly rated and available ASAP.

Again, I apologize for this experience. This isn't the standard we hold ourselves to.

Best,
[Agent Name]
[Direct contact: phone/chat]
```

---

### Issue 2C: Time Extension Disputes

**Priority:** P2

**Scenario:** Customer declined time extension OR professional didn't request but wants payment for extra time

**Process:**
1. Review booking details and agreed scope
2. Check if extension was requested via app
3. Review customer decision (approved/declined)
4. Check professional time records (GPS checkout time)

**Outcome Decision Matrix:**

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Professional requested → Customer approved | Charge customer for extension (automatic) |
| Professional requested → Customer declined | Professional must complete original scope, no extra payment |
| Professional didn't request → worked extra time | No extra payment (professional's responsibility to request) |
| Customer claims extra work wasn't needed | Review booking scope, decide case-by-case |

**Response Template (Customer Declined Extension):**
```
Hi [Name],

I reviewed your booking [Booking ID] and the time extension request.

I see you declined the additional time, which is absolutely your right. The professional was expected to complete the agreed scope within the original booking time.

[If professional completed original scope]: The service was completed as agreed, so no additional charges apply.

[If professional left early/incomplete]: This violates our policy. I've issued a [partial/full] refund and flagged the professional's account.

Is there anything else about this booking I can help with?

Best,
[Agent Name]
```

### Issue 2D: GPS Check-In Failures

**Priority:** P1 (if preventing service), P2 (if post-service inquiry)

**Process:**
1. Verify professional location (if possible, check device GPS data)
2. Check professional's GPS history (frequent failures = potential fraud)
3. Determine if legitimate technical issue or fraud attempt

**Legitimate Technical Issues:**

- Known GPS signal issues in area
- Device-specific known issues
- Weather conditions affecting GPS

**Fraud Indicators:**
- Repeated GPS failures

```
Hi [Professional Name],

I see you had trouble with GPS check-in for booking [Booking ID].

I've manually verified your location and approved the check-in. You can proceed with service.

**To prevent future GPS issues:**
- Enable location permissions (Settings → MaidConnect → Location: Always)
- Ensure GPS is enabled on device

If this continues, please contact support before your next booking.

Best,

Hi [Professional Name],

Thank you for bringing this review to my attention. I've carefully reviewed the booking [Booking ID] and the customer's comments.

**My Review:**
I understand you feel the review is unfair. However, the customer's comments reflect their personal experience, which they're entitled to share. The review doesn't violate our review guidelines (no profanity, threats, or false claims).

**What You Can Do:**
1. Respond professionally to the review (visible to future customers)
   - Acknowledge their concern
   - Explain your perspective calmly
   - Show how you'd handle it differently
2. Focus on future bookings (one review won't destroy your rating)
3. Learn from the feedback (if there's any validity)

**Good Response Example:**
"I'm sorry you felt [issue]. My intention was [explain]. In the future, I'll [improvement]. Thank you for the feedback."

Remember: How you respond to negative reviews shows professionalism and builds trust with future customers.

Best,
[Agent Name]
```

**Response Template (Review Removed):**
```
Hi [Professional Name],

After reviewing your dispute, I've determined the review violates our guidelines and will be removed.

- Manual: Customer complaint, support team escalation

**Step 2: Investigation**

- Determine severity

**Step 3: Suspension Decision**
- **Temporary Suspension:** 7, 14, or 30 days
- **Permanent Ban:** For serious safety or fraud violations
- **Warning Only:** For first-time minor violations
